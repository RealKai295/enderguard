Take full control of what players can store in their ender chests! This lightweight and easy-to-use plugin allows server owners to block specific items from being placed inside ender chests, enhancing balance, fairness, and gameplay control across your server.





**Key Features:**

✅ Block Any Item: Easily specify which items players are not allowed to place in ender chests.

⚙️ Fully Customizable: Edit the config.yml to define blocked items using item IDs or material names.

🔄 Lightweight & Efficient: Designed for performance – no unnecessary overhead or lag.

🔒 Enforce Fair Gameplay: Prevent overpowered gear, rare items, or banned blocks from being stored secretly.


**How It Works:**

Once installed, the plugin listens for attempts to place blocked items into an ender chest. If the item is listed in the config, the placement is cancelled, and a customizable message can notify the player.


**Use Cases:**

Ban players from hiding illegal items in their ender chest.
Prevent players from saving event gear or admin kits.
Enhance survival servers by restricting the hoarding of rare resources.


**Installation Instructions:**

Place the plugin .jar file into your server’s /plugins directory.

Restart your server.

(Optional) Open the config.yml file to define which items are blocked.
